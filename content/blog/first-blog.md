So today at mid night, I am writing this blog and I am very excited about it. Because this is my first blog on [my website](https://bugswriter.com).
I always wanted this. My own place on "The Internet", where I can write whatever I want. I don't like getting censored.
This is the main reason why I chose to write here, instead of structuring my rant into 280 character on twitter.
<!-- more -->
Internet is an amazing place, It changed my life. I don't want to go deep on Internet situation.
Since **this is my first blog, this is going to be completely topicless**.


## What's the deal here?

-   This blog is just a part of [my website](https://bugswriter.com) and I have intentions to manage this website/blog my whole life. This way I can document my life and thoughts,
    and people can know me even after I die.
    I want to make it public, since I have some issues interacting with people and making friends. People can know me without even contacting me.

-   If you have no interest in my life, well here I will also write about tech and other stuff I learn, so those articles can be useful for you.

-   I believe my blogs will be highly informal. If I end up in some bad day/mood. I might write some really nasty stuff. Lets hope this never happen.

-   I also want to improve my English writing skills. Seems like a great way to do it.

-   I hate writing on garbage social media platforms (_example - facebook, twitter, quora_). Here I will feel more free and my words don't get mixed with noise.


## Some words regarding my poor writing

I want to make this clear, I am not good with English. So don't expect good literature from me. I write in exact same manner I speak.
I would love to get corrected so if you find any spelling mistake or grammar mistake please [contact me](https://bugswriter.com/contact/).


## How I got inspiration to start this blog?

I visited [Richard Stallman Personal Website](https://stallman.org) and I love it. He is my true inpiration. The way he right against non free softwares,
it motivated me to do the same.


## On this blog I will write about..

-   My life
-   Free Software
-   Hate speeches for non free softwares
-   Places I might visit in future
-   Anything new I explore
-   Movies / TV shows
-   My Opinions about random events
-   It can be anything so this list is stupid


## In the end

I will try very hard to write regularly. So please subscribe to [Atom feed](https://bugswriter.com/atom.xml) for regular updates
